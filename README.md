## Abstract

In recent years, remote training has gained significant attention as a means to bridge geographical distances and enable individuals to improve their skills remotely. However, accurately tracking, analyzing, and comparing complex hand and finger movements in real-time poses a critical challenge in remote training, as it is essential for providing precise feedback and facilitating skill development. This project focuses specifically on the application of flexible sensor gloves in surgical training.

Traditionally, assessing surgical technical skills for novice surgeons has relied on evaluations by expert surgeons. However, limitations arise when expert surgeons observe and provide feedback on the skills of novice surgeons due to the difficulty of maintaining a direct line of sight and the need for physical presence. 

To address this challenge, this research proposal aims to develop a cutting-edge solution using a flexible glove embedded with nine 9-axis Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The glove, equipped with sophisticated algorithms, will enable real-time capture, analysis, and wireless transmission of hand movement data to an end device. A mobile application will be used to provide real-time feedback to surgeons during training.

The outcomes of this research have the potential to transform the way training is conducted, particularly in the field of surgical skills development. By leveraging the capabilities of the flexible glove and advanced algorithms, this project aims to revolutionize remote learning by enabling individuals to reach new levels of skill and proficiency. Additionally, the technology developed in this project holds potential for applications in various fields, including music education, sports coaching, sign language detection, virtual reality gaming, and physical rehabilitation.
